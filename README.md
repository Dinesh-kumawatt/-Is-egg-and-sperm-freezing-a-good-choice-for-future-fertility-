# -Is-egg-and-sperm-freezing-a-good-choice-for-future-fertility-

Egg and sperm freezing is a powerful option for individuals who want to preserve their fertility. Itâ€™s ideal for those delaying parenthood due to career, education, or personal reasons, and also for cancer patients undergoing treatments that can harm fertility. Egg quality declines with age, so freezing at a younger age increases future success chances. Sperm freezing is simpler and widely used by men before surgeries, chemotherapy, or long absences. Trinity IVF Ahmedabad uses advanced cryopreservation to maintain cell viability. Fertility preservation empowers you to take control of your reproductive future.
